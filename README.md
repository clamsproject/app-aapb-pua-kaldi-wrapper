# AAPB-PUA Kaldi Wrapper

## Description

Wrapping a Kaldi instance (https://github.com/brandeis-llc/aapb-pua-kaldi-docker) to a CLAMS app. 

## User instruction

General user instructions for CLAMS apps is available at [CLAMS Apps documentation](https://apps.clams.ai/clamsapp).

### System requirements

The underlying Kaldi instance was originally built for and delivered as a Docker image. Therefore, the system requirements are basically the same as the Docker image.
Namely, 

* Enough disk space (Image size is 12GB compressed, 24GB uncompressed).
* Enough RAM assigned to the container library. At least 6GB. The more, the better.)
